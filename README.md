# Student-Assessment-Meta-Data-Analysis
Analysis of student meta data using PCA, K-means and K-medoids.\
The file named "Cluster Composition Anlysis" contains the implementation of both the K-means and K-medoids models and an analysis of the clusters created.\
The file named "student analysis PCA" contains the creation of various visualisations for describing the student datasets as well as the implementation of a PCA analysis.\ 
Files containing actual student data are not included due to the sensitive nature of the data. This repository is merely an example of the owners ability to implement this kind of analysis.
